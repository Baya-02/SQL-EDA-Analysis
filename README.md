# SQL_EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project performed using SQL. The analysis is based on a **data warehouse** I previously built (see related repo: [`SQL-DataWareHouse-Project`]((https://github.com/Baya-02/SQL-DataWareHouse-Project))) and focuses on uncovering insights through structured queries.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This EDA project aims to:
- Explore and understand the structure and content of a data warehouse.
- Extract meaningful insights through aggregation, ranking, and dimensional analysis.
- Practice real-world SQL skills commonly used in business intelligence and data analytics roles.

The project was inspired by and guided through the resources of a YouTuber in the data analytics community.

## 📁 Project Structure

The analysis follows these key steps:

1. **Database Exploration**  
   Basic structure check, table inspection, and understanding key relationships.

2. **Dimension Exploration**  
   Analysis of various categorical dimensions (e.g., customers, products, locations).

3. **Date Range Exploration**  
   Inspection of temporal data, coverage period, and completeness.

4. **Measure Exploration**  
   Investigation of key metrics: sales, quantity, revenue, and other KPIs.

5. **Magnitude & Ranking Analysis**  
   Ranking top-performing dimensions and identifying trends or outliers.

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed

- Calculated **aggregated metrics** (e.g., totals, averages) for quick insights.
- Identified **overall trends** and **spotted anomalies** across the dataset.
- Grouped results by **specific dimensions** to understand data distribution.
- **Ranked** products, customers, and other entities by performance metrics.
- Quantified and segmented data to reveal actionable insights.
